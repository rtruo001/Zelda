This is the repository for the Zelda game.

The implementation of the Zelda game was done in a software called GameMaker (version 8.0 Lite)
GameMaker is required to open the implementation.
Zelda.exe is the executable for the game.

Game mechanics:
The arrow keys are to move around while the space bar is used to attack an enemy.
The goal is to reach the Triforce at the end.
Have fun!
